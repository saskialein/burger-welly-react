What’s your understanding of the role of diversity in software development? And how to support inclusivity in teams, products and businesses? - I think that diversity is absolutely necessary in software development.

Inclusivity could be supported by introducing a company culture where every voice is welcome, heard, and respected, where diverse thinking is embraced and constructive and kind feedback is given to everyone to improve.
